# MusicAppFunctionality

# What I'm trying to solve
  Create a Message Board App that will help users find band members within an area.
  This App will also include the function to create different types of posts such as:
    Find a BandMate,
    Find an already established band and offer talent,
    Post about an Event that will be happening related to a band such as Busking or a Gig,
    Find a Band to perform at an event.
  This App will allow users to reply to a Post as well. A user will be able to create a profile and list their prefered genres and instruments played.
    
# Who will interact with the App
  This App is designed for music enthusiasts and anyone in need of band members. This app will also help keep users up to date with events going on in ceratin areas. 

# Core functionality

  User can create a post loking for band members to jam with or join a band.

# Future enhancements
